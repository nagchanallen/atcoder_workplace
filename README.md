## How to use the auto-gen ABC shell script (for macos)

1. Go to project root directory
2. Run `$ chmod 755 genABCNewFiles.sh`
3. Run `$ ./genABCNewFiles.sh`
4. When you are running the script, you need to input the folder name.
5. The script would help you generate a folder with your input name including 8 files named `A.cpp` to `H.cpp` which copied from `cptemplate.cpp` in root directory.
