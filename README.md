## How to use the auto-gen ABC shell script (for macos)

1. Go to project root directory, run the following commands:
   $ chmod 755 genABCNewFiles.sh
   $ ./genABCNewFiles.sh

2. When you are running the script, you need to input the folder name.

3. The script would help you generate a folder with your input name including 8 files named A-H.cpp which copied from "cptemplate.cpp" in root directory. Then you would be redirected to the created folder in terminal.
